# Monitor Instellar.app in Real-Time

We understand the importance of having visibility on our services. We're making our status page available from today onwards. We will also be using this page as a place to track scheduled maintenance and any incidents that occur in our platform. Feel free to bookmark [our status page](https://status.instellar.app).
