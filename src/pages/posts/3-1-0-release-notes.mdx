# 3.1.0 Release Notes

We're thrilled to announce the latest upgrade to our platform - version 3.1.0! Our team has been working hard to make some exciting changes that will improve your experience and prepare our platform for future growth. Let's dive into the details:

## Better Cluster Monitoring

A healthy cluster is crucial to ensuring your web services run smoothly. That's why we've upgraded our cluster monitoring from polling-based monitoring to real-time socket-based monitoring. This means that any changes in the cluster are immediately communicated to our platform, allowing us to take the health of the cluster into account before doing any deploys or upgrades. This helps us avoid any issues and ensures that you can continue with your deployments as soon as the cluster recovers.

## Preparing for the Future

We've made some changes to the underlying structure of the application to make way for some new features we're planning to ship in the near future. This upgrade includes all those changes, opening up many opportunities for our platform to grow even further. We can't wait to share these exciting new features with you!

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

We're committed to delivering the best possible experience for our users, which is why we've resolved some bugs in the system. Specifically, we've fixed a bug related to computing whether to upgrade or bootstrap and introduced a mechanic to automatically issue a new installation when an expired one is detected. This will enable applications to automatically heal from expired token scenarios when fetching env variables, ensuring a smoother experience for all our users.

We hope you're as excited as we are about the latest upgrade to our platform. We're always working hard to improve and bring you new features, and we can't wait to see how you'll use them. As always, if you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.
