In this section we show you how to use the [hetzner terraform module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/upmaru/instellar/hetzner/latest) to setup your own infrastructure on hetzner provider.

import { Callout } from '@components/Callout'

## Setup Project

You can use our [terraform-module-template](https://github.com/upmaru/terraform-module-template) to create a repository. Click on the `Use this template` link on the repo.

![use module template](/docs/github/use-module-template.png)

Name the module and simply clone the repository down.

Let's begin by cloning our repository we created using the template.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:<your-organization>/<your-repo>.git
```

### Cluster Bootstrap

Once you've cloned down the repository simply replace the `cluster_name` with the desired name for your cluster. You can also update the `node_size` and the `size` parameter in the `cluster_topology` based on the value you wish to use from list of slugs from hcloud.

Once you've updated the values create a `.auto.tfvars` and add your tokens.

```hcl
hcloud_token = <your hetzner api token>
instellar_auth_token = <your instellar auth token>
```

You can get the `instellar_auth_token` by [signing up](https://web.instellar.app/auth/registrations/new) and heading over to the `Credentials` page on instellar.


### SSH Key

This section assumes you already know how to generate the ssh-key. If you don't know how to do this I recommend [this post](https://medium.com/risan/upgrade-your-ssh-key-to-ed25519-c6e8d60d3c54). To add the ssh-key to Hetzner. Head to the `Security` area. Under your project. Click on the `Add SSH Key` button.

![security section](/docs/hetzner/security-section.png)

You will see the following modal box. You can copy your public key into the box and give the key a name. You can copy the public key by running

```shell
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

This will print out your public key and you can copy it and paste it as the content of the key. The name is important you'll need to use it in the `main.tf` file.

![add ssh key](/docs/hetzner/add-ssh-key.png)

Once you add the key, you can refrence the name inside the `main.tf` file.
## API Token

Before you push to your repository let's look at how we can retrieve the API token to be used with Hetzner cloud on terraform cloud.

Head over to the `Security` section under the project. Then Click on the `API tokens` tab.

![api tokens tab](/docs/hetzner/api-tokens-tab.png)

Go ahead and click the `Generate API Token`, you'll be prompted with the following. Make sure you select `Read & Write`. Give it a recognizable name like `Terraform`.

![generate api token](/docs/hetzner/generate-api-token.png)

You'll get to see the token once. Copy it and either use it in your `.auto.tfvars` or your terraform cloud.

## Running Locally via CLI

<Callout title="Sensitive Token" type="warning">
The `hcloud_token` variable should not be checked into your code repository.
</Callout>

 If you're planning on running terraform locally, you can create a `.auto.tfvars` file and add the variable there. This file will only exist locally on your machine and will not be checked into your github repo.

```hcl
hcloud_token = "<your-hcloud-token>"
```

If you use the template above the `.auto.tfvars` is automatically ignored.

Once all the configuration files are in place simply run:

```shell
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
