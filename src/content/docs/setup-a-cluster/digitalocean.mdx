In this section we show you how to use the [digitalocean terraform module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/upmaru/instellar/digitalocean/latest) to setup your own infrastructure on digital ocean provider.

import { Callout } from '@components/Callout'

## Setup Project

You can use our [digitalocean template](https://github.com/insterra/digitalocean-compute) to create a repository. Click on the `Use this template` link on the repo.

![use module template](/docs/github/use-module-template.png)

Name the module and simply clone the repository down.

Let's begin by cloning our repository we created using the template.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:<your-organization>/<your-repo>.git
```

### Cluster Bootstrap

Once you've cloned down the repository simply replace the `cluster_name` with the desired name for your cluster. You can also update the `node_size` and the `size` parameter in the `cluster_topology` based on the value you wish to use from list of slugs provided by digitalocean.

Once you've updated the values create a `.auto.tfvars` and add your tokens.

```hcl
do_token = <your digital ocean api token>
instellar_auth_token = <your instellar auth token>
```

You can get the `instellar_auth_token` by [signing up](https://web.instellar.app/auth/registrations/new) and heading over to the `Credentials` page on instellar.


### SSH Key

This section assumes you already know how to generate the ssh-key. If you don't know how to do this I recommend [this post](https://medium.com/risan/upgrade-your-ssh-key-to-ed25519-c6e8d60d3c54). To add the ssh-key to digital ocean. Head to the `Settings` area.

![settings](/docs/digital-ocean/settings.png)

Find the `Security` tab.

![security tab](/docs/digital-ocean/security-tab.png)

Click on the `Add SSH Key` button.

![add ssh key](/docs/digital-ocean/add-ssh-key.png)

Copy your public key from the command line and paste it in the `SSH Key content` area. Give it a name and click `Add SSH Key`.

![new ssh key modal](/docs/digital-ocean/new-ssh-key-modal)

Once add the ssh key you can copy the finger print and use it in your `main.tf`.

## API Token

Let's look at how we can retrieve the API token to be used with digital ocean on terraform cloud.

Head over to the `API` section on the main navigation.

![api nav](/docs/digital-ocean/api-nav.png)

You'll see the personal access token area. Click on the `Generate New Token` button.

![personal access tokens](/docs/digital-ocean/personal-access-tokens.png)

Give your token a name. I suggest naming it with your cluster name and prefix it with `terraform`. So you know this token is being utilized by terraform.

For expiration you can use `90 days` or longer. Do remember to change this token in terraform cloud. 

Once you've entered the name and chosen the expiration time for the token click `Generate Token`.

![new personal access token](/docs/digital-ocean/new-personal-access-token.png)

You'll get to see the token once. Copy it and either use it in your `.auto.tfvars` or your terraform cloud. 

## Running Locally via CLI

<Callout title="Sensitive Token" type="warning">
The `hcloud_token` variable should not be checked into your code repository.
</Callout>

The `do_token` variable should not be checked into your code repository. If you're planning on running terraform locally, you can create a `.auto.tfvars` file and add the variable there. This file will only exist locally on your machine and will not be checked into your github repo.

```hcl
do_token = "<your-do-token>"
```

If you use the template above the `.auto.tfvars` is automatically ignored.

Once all the configuration files are in place simply run:

```shell
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
