In this section we show you how to use the [aws terraform module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/upmaru/instellar/aws/latest) to setup your own infrastructure on Amazon AWS provider.

import { Callout } from '@components/Callout'

## Setup Project

You can use our [aws template](https://github.com/insterra/aws-compute) to create a repository. Click on the `Use this template` link on the repo.

![use module template](/docs/github/use-module-template.png)

Name the module and simply clone the repository down.

Let's begin by cloning our repository we created using the template.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:<your-organization>/<your-repo>.git
```

### Cluster Bootstrap

Once you've cloned down the repository simply replace the `cluster_name` with the desired name for your cluster. You can also update the `node_size` and the `size` parameter in the `cluster_topology` based on the value you wish to use from aws ec2 instance sizes.

Once you've updated the values create a `.auto.tfvars` and add your tokens.

```hcl
aws_access_key = <your aws access key>
aws_secret_key = <your aws secret key>
instellar_auth_token = <your instellar auth token>
```

You can get the `instellar_auth_token` by [signing up](https://opsmaru.com/auth/users/register) and heading over to the `Credentials` page on instellar.

### SSH Key

This section assumes you already know how to generate the ssh-key. If you don't know how to do this I recommend [this post](https://medium.com/risan/upgrade-your-ssh-key-to-ed25519-c6e8d60d3c54). To add the ssh-key to Amazon AWS. Head to the EC2 Dashboard and look for the `Key Pairs` link.

![key pairs](/docs/aws/key-pairs.png)

Click the `Import key pair` button.

![create key pair](/docs/aws/import-key-pair.png)

You can import the key pair by copying your public key and paste it in the box.

![import key pair](/docs/aws/import-key-pair-form.png)

Once you've added your public key you can copy the name and use it in your `main.tf`.

## AWS Access and Secret Key

Let's look at how we can retrieve the Access Key and Secret Key to be used with the terraform module.

Head over to the IAM section

![iam section](/docs/aws/iam-section.png)

Click the `Add users` button.

![add users](/docs/aws/iam-add-users.png)

Give the user a name and simply click `Next`.

![create user form](/docs/aws/iam-create-user-form.png)

You'll need to attach the `AdministratorAccess` role to the user, and click `Next`.

![attach policy](/docs/aws/attach-policy.png)

Review all the details and once you're ready click `Create user`.

![create user](/docs/aws/review-and-create.png)

Once you created the user go to the user detail, and click on the `Security credentials` page.

![user detail](/docs/aws/user-detail.png)

Find the `Access keys` section and click `Create access key`

![access key section](/docs/aws/access-key-section.png)

Select `Other` and click `Next`.

![create access key](/docs/aws/create-access-key.png)

Set description for your access key

![set description](/docs/aws/set-description-access-key.png)

Finally you can retrieve your access key.

![retrieve access key](/docs/aws/retrieve-access-key.png)

The access key should never be checked into your code repository. This is for running locally or using in terraform cloud only. If running locally you can put these values in `.auto.tfvars`.

## Running Locally via CLI

<Callout title="Sensitive Token" type="warning">
The `aws_access_key` and `aws_secret_key` variable should not be checked into your code repository.
</Callout>

Create the `.auto.tfvars` in your working directory. This file should not be checked into your code repository.

```hcl
aws_access_key = "<aws-access-key>"
aws_secret_key = "<aws-secret-key>"
```

If you use the template above the `.auto.tfvars` is automatically ignored.

Once all the configuration files are in place simply run:

```shell
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
