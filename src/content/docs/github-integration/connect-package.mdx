import { Callout } from '@components/Callout'

<Callout title="Pre-requisite">
This page assumes that you've already created some packages under your instellar organization. If you haven't already done that we suggest you do that first.
</Callout>

If you're ready to move forward, click on one of your packages. You should see something like this.

![new package](/docs/instellar/new-package.png)

Go ahead and click `Configure` this will display a list of github repositories you can connect to your package.

Simply click `Connect` and you're done!

![connectable repository](/docs/instellar/connectable-repository.png)

Once connected you will see the repository status on your package as `Active`

Instellar will now configure your repository for deployment! Next you will need to configure your [deployment workflow](/docs/github-integration/deployment/) and `instellar.yml` file.
