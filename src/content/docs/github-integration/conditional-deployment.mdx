title: Deployment depending on the status of CI
section: Github Integration
---

This section will show you how to configure your `deployment.yml` to take into account the status of your continuous integration step. We have a [code example](https://github.com/upmaru-stage/rdio) here for an elixir app, if you wish to skip to reading the source.

import { Callout } from '@components/Callout'

<Callout title="A note on INSTELLAR_ENDPOINT" type="warning">
The examples in the codebase we referenced the `.github/workflows/deployment.yml` file will contain a value for `INSTELLAR_ENDPOINT` this is only necessary in those repositories since they're deploying to our staging environment. For our customers we recommend omitting this value.
</Callout>

Conditional deployments are useful for cases where you have a continuous integration step that runs your tests, linting or any other checks. If these checks pass then do the deployment. If this is something you want to have as your build pipeline then this page is for you.

We will not cover how the CI step is written because we believe that will be different for every project. Regardless of how the CI step is the following instruction should be the same.

## Changes to the Event

When we're deploying based on the CI workflow we need to make our `on` clause aware of the `CI` step. Feel free to customize the `branches` as you see fit.

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run: 
    workflows: ["CI"]
    branches: [master, develop]
    types: 
      - completed
```

## Job Definition

Let's take a look at our job definition. You'll see we've introduced an `if` condition that depends on the workflow_run's conclusion. The `build_and_deploy` will only run of the conclusion turns out to be a `success`

```yaml
jobs:
  build_and_deploy:
    name: Build and Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    if: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success' }}
    steps:
```

The rest of the steps should be mostly the same

```yaml
      - name: 'Checkout'
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_branch }}
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: 'Pakman'
        uses: upmaru/pakman@alpine-3.17-7.1
        with:
          command: 'bootstrap'
        env:
          ABUILD_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{secrets.ABUILD_PRIVATE_KEY}}
          ABUILD_PUBLIC_KEY: ${{secrets.ABUILD_PUBLIC_KEY}}

      - name: 'Build APK'
        uses: upmaru/pakman@alpine-3.17-7.1
        with:
          entrypoint: /var/lib/pakman/bin/build.sh

      - name: 'Archive'
        uses: upmaru/pakman@alpine-3.17-7.1
        with:
          entrypoint: /var/lib/pakman/bin/archive.sh

      - name: 'Create Deployment'
        uses: upmaru/pakman@alpine-3.17-7.1
        with:
          command: 'create_deployment'
          archive: 'packages.zip'
        env:
          WORKFLOW_REF: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_branch }}
          WORKFLOW_SHA: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_sha }}
          INSTELLAR_PACKAGE_TOKEN: ${{secrets.INSTELLAR_PACKAGE_TOKEN}}
          INSTELLAR_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.INSTELLAR_AUTH_TOKEN}}
```

If you look closely you'll see that the `WORKFLOW_REF` and `WORKFLOW_SHA` is slightly different than before. We are now referencing the values from the `workflow_run`.

## Putting it Together

The final file looks something like this.

```yaml
name: 'Deployment'

on:
  workflow_run: 
    workflows: ["CI"]
    branches: [master, develop]
    types: 
      - completed

jobs:
  build_and_deploy:
    name: Build and Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    if: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success' }}
    steps:
      - name: 'Checkout'
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          ref: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_branch }}
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: 'Pakman'
        uses: upmaru/pakman@alpine-3.17-7.1
        with:
          command: 'bootstrap'
        env:
          ABUILD_PRIVATE_KEY: ${{secrets.ABUILD_PRIVATE_KEY}}
          ABUILD_PUBLIC_KEY: ${{secrets.ABUILD_PUBLIC_KEY}}

      - name: 'Build APK'
        uses: upmaru/pakman@alpine-3.17-7.1
        with:
          entrypoint: /var/lib/pakman/bin/build.sh

      - name: 'Archive'
        uses: upmaru/pakman@alpine-3.17-7.1
        with:
          entrypoint: /var/lib/pakman/bin/archive.sh

      - name: 'Create Deployment'
        uses: upmaru/pakman@alpine-3.17-7.1
        with:
          command: 'create_deployment'
          archive: 'packages.zip'
        env:
          WORKFLOW_REF: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_branch }}
          WORKFLOW_SHA: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_sha }}
          INSTELLAR_PACKAGE_TOKEN: ${{secrets.INSTELLAR_PACKAGE_TOKEN}}
          INSTELLAR_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.INSTELLAR_AUTH_TOKEN}}
```
