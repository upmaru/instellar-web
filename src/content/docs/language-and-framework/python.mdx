This page takes you through setting up instellar for a Django application. You will learn how to configure your application to run on your PaaS

## Example Application

We've created an [example application](https://github.com/upmaru-stage/monty) in case you wish to skip staright to the source code.

import { Callout } from '@components/Callout'

<Callout title="A note on INSTELLAR_ENDPOINT" type="warning">
The examples in the codebase we referenced the `.github/workflows/deployment.yml` file will contain a value for `INSTELLAR_ENDPOINT` this is only necessary in those repositories since they're deploying to our staging environment. For our customers we recommend omitting this value.
</Callout>
