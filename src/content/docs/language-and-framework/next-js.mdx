This page takes you through setting up instellar for a Next.js application. You will learn how to configure your application to run on your PaaS.

## Example Application

We've created an [example application](https://github.com/upmaru-stage/nimbus) in case you wish to skip right to the source code.

<Callout title="A note on INSTELLAR_ENDPOINT" type="warning">
The examples in the codebase we referenced the `.github/workflows/deployment.yml` file will contain a value for `INSTELLAR_ENDPOINT` this is only necessary in those repositories since they're deploying to our staging environment. For our customers we recommend omitting this value.
</Callout>

<Callout title="A note on next 13.3.0">
The example uses next `13.2.4` because later version [has a bug](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/48077) that causes the `next/image` module to not work properly. We recommend sticking with `13.2.4` until the bug is resolved.
</Callout>

In this example we build a Next.js using the standalone option. In this configuration `next/image` is also fully working as intended.

## next.config.js

You will need to add the configuration to tell next to build a `standalone` production build. Your next config file should look something like this.

```js
const withNextra = require('nextra')({
  theme: 'nextra-theme-blog',
  themeConfig: './theme.config.js',
})

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'standalone'
}

module.exports = withNextra(nextConfig)
```

## instellar.yml

This file is used to describe to PAKman how to build your application. The following is taken from a Next.js based application. This configuration will change depending on your application. This file will work with a freshly generated Next.js app.

### Dependencies

Let's begin with the `dependencies`. You will also notice we're enabling `trace: true` in our dependencies. This will enable dependency tracing, which means even if we miss some dependency in our `runtime` the build tool will trace the dependency and automatically include it in our package. That's cool!

```yaml
dependencies:
  trace: true
  build:
    - nodejs
    - npm
    - vips-dev
  runtime:
    - nodejs
    - npm
    - bash
    - curl
    - s6
    - jq
    - ca-certificates
    - icu-data-full
    - nimbus-openrc
```

### Choosing a Stack

We're using alpine as the base image for all the containers that run the applications. We recommend using `alpine/3.17` for all applications. However please check the [alpine packages](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages) listing to see compatibility for your language and framework. In this case alpine/3.17 will run node `18.14.2`.

You can choose from the following:

- alpine/edge
- alpine/3.17
- alpine/3.16
- alpine/3.15

```yaml
stack: alpine/3.17
```

### Build

The below section tells PAKman how to build your application. We're simply installing the dependencies by running `npm install`. Then we're running the build.

Since we're building a `standalone` version of Next.js we will also need to copy the static files over to be served by the next server. This is based on the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/output-file-tracing#how-it-works).

```yaml
build:
  destinations: 
    - '.next/standalone'
  command: |
    npm install
    npm run build

    cp -r .next/static .next/standalone/.next/
    cp -r public .next/standalone/
```

### Run

The below section explains how your application is run. 

The `services` section enables you to define how your application runs. In this case we also have to define the `path` setting. Since we're not using a binary built inside of our app. We're using the OS level nodejs to run our server.

```yaml
run: 
  name: nimbus
  services:
  - name: web
    binary: node
    path: /usr/bin
    start:
      call: 'standalone/server.js'
```

### Hooks

### Hooks

These are the lifecycle of the alpine packages. You can define their behaviour. Generally we don't expect this to change from app to app. However feel free to adjust as required.

In this case `rc-update add nimbus` will add our `nimbus` app to the default run. This will ensure our app automatically starts when the container is restarted (incase it needs to restart).

The `rc-service nimbus migrate` will run the migration. In this case it will run after the package is installed and after the upgrade.

- `rc-service nimbus start` will start the application
- `rc-service nimbus stop` will simply stop the application

Your application will be built into openrc and supervised by the [`s6` supervisor suite](https://github.com/skarnet/s6).

```yaml
hook:
  post-install: |
    rc-update add nimbus

  pre-upgrade: |
    rc-service nimbus stop

  post-upgrade: |
    rc-service nimbus start

  post-deinstall: |
    rc-service nimbus stop
    rc-update del rdio
```

## Putting it together

The final file looks like the following:

```yaml
dependencies:
  trace: true
  build:
    - nodejs
    - npm
    - vips-dev
  runtime:
    - nodejs
    - npm
    - bash
    - curl
    - s6
    - jq
    - ca-certificates
    - icu-data-full
    - nimbus-openrc

stack: alpine/3.17

build:
  destinations: 
    - '.next/standalone'
  command: |
    npm install
    npm run build

    cp -r .next/static .next/standalone/.next/
    cp -r public .next/standalone/

run: 
  name: nimbus
  services:
  - name: web
    binary: node
    path: /usr/bin
    start:
      call: 'standalone/server.js'

hook:
  post-install: |
    rc-update add nimbus

  pre-upgrade: |
    rc-service nimbus stop

  post-upgrade: |
    rc-service nimbus start

  post-deinstall: |
    rc-service nimbus stop
    rc-update del rdio
```
