This page takes you through setting up instellar for a Gin / GORM application. You will learn how to configure your application to run on your PaaS

## Example Application

We've created an [example application](https://github.com/upmaru-stage/gemini) in case you want to skip straight to the source code.

import { Callout } from '@components/Callout'

<Callout title="A note on INSTELLAR_ENDPOINT" type="warning">
The examples in the codebase we referenced the `.github/workflows/deployment.yml` file will contain a value for `INSTELLAR_ENDPOINT` this is only necessary in those repositories since they're deploying to our staging environment. For our customers we recommend omitting this value.
</Callout>

The gin / gorm application is built using the default `go build` command.

## main.go

To enable our application to be able to run in multiple modes we're simply passing in the command line argument either `web` or `migrate`.

You can see in the `main` function.

```go
func main() {
	mode := os.Args[1]

	switch mode {
	case "web":
		web()
	case "migrate":
		migrate()
	default:
		web()
	}
}
```

This means when we build our application we can pass the `mode` we want to use and the application will either start the `web` application or run `migrate`.


## instellar.yml

This file is used to describe to PAKman how to build your application. The following is taken from a gin / gorm based application. This configuration will change depending on your application's requirements.

### Dependencies

Let's take a look at our `dependencies` section. You'll notice that we're enabling `trace: true` in our dependencies. This will enable dependency tracing, which means if we miss some dependency in our `runtime` section the build tool will trace the dependency and automatically include it in our package. Super awesome!

We're including `go` in the `build` section since we need go to build our application.

```yaml
dependencies:
  trace: true
  build:
    - go
  runtime:
    - bash
    - curl
    - s6
    - jq
    - ca-certificates
    - gemini-openrc
```

### Choosing a Stack

We're using alpine as the base iamge for all the containers that run the applications. We recommend using `alpine/3.17` for all applications. However please check the [alpine packages](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages) listing to see compatibility for your language and framework. In this case alpine/3.17 will run go `1.19.8`.

You can choose from the following:

- alpine/edge
- alpine/3.17
- alpine/3.16
- alpine/3.15

```yaml
stack: alpine/3.17
```

### Build

Go has a very simple but powerful build system. In this example we're simply running `go build` with the output option to specify where go should output the built binary.

```yaml
build:
  destinations: 
    - bin
  command: |
    go build -o bin/gemini
```

### Run

The below section explains how your application is run. In this case we're defining the `commands` to be able to run migration for our app. The `services` section is used to define our `web` service. The default go build will enable us to simply call the binary and pass the command we specified in `main.go`.

```yaml
run: 
  name: gemini
  commands:
    - name: migrate
      binary: gemini
      call: 'migrate'
  services:
    - name: web
      binary: gemini
      start:
        call: 'web'
```

### Hooks

These are the lifecycle of the alpine packages. You can define their behaviour. Generally we don't expect this to change from app to app. However feel free to adjust as required.

In this case `rc-update add gemini` will add our `gemini` app to the default run. This will ensure our app automatically starts when the container is restarted (incase it needs to restart).

The `rc-service gemini migrate` will run the migration. In this case it will run after the package is installed and after the upgrade.

- `rc-service gemini start` will start the application
- `rc-service gemini stop` will simply stop the application

Your application will be built into openrc and supervised by the [`s6` supervisor suite](https://github.com/skarnet/s6).


```yaml
hook:
  post-install: |
    rc-update add gemini
    rc-service gemini migrate

  pre-upgrade: |
    rc-service gemini stop

  post-upgrade: |
    rc-service gemini migrate
    rc-service gemini start

  post-deinstall: |
    rc-service gemini stop
    rc-update del gemini
```

## Putting it together

The final file looks like the following:

```yaml
dependencies:
  trace: true
  build:
    - go
  runtime:
    - bash
    - curl
    - s6
    - jq
    - ca-certificates
    - gemini-openrc

stack: alpine/3.17

build:
  destinations: 
    - bin
  command: |
    go build -o bin/gemini

run: 
  name: gemini
  commands:
    - name: migrate
      binary: gemini
      call: 'migrate'
  services:
    - name: web
      binary: gemini
      start:
        call: 'web'

hook:
  post-install: |
    rc-update add gemini
    rc-service gemini migrate

  pre-upgrade: |
    rc-service gemini stop

  post-upgrade: |
    rc-service gemini migrate
    rc-service gemini start

  post-deinstall: |
    rc-service gemini stop
    rc-update del gemini
```
