This page takes you through setting up instellar on a Ruby on Rails application. You will learn how to configure your application to run on your PaaS

## Example Application

We've created an [example application](https://github.com/upmaru-stage/locomo) incase you wish to skip and go straight to the source code.

import { Callout } from '@components/Callout'

<Callout title="A note on INSTELLAR_ENDPOINT" type="warning">
The examples in the codebase we referenced the `.github/workflows/deployment.yml` file will contain a value for `INSTELLAR_ENDPOINT` this is only necessary in those repositories since they're deploying to our staging environment. For our customers we recommend omitting this value.
</Callout>

## instellar.yml

This file is used to describe to PAKman how to build your application. The following is taken from a Ruby on Rails based application. This configuration will change depending on your application. This file will work with a freshly generated rails app.

### Dependencies

The dependencies section enables you to define OS packages for your application. This list may grow if your application depends on more OS level packages.

```yaml
dependencies:
  build:
    - ruby
    - ruby-bundler
    - ruby-dev
    - ruby-tzinfo
    - libpq-dev
  runtime:
    - bash
    - curl
    - jq
    - ca-certificates
    - s6
    - ruby
    - ruby-bundler
    - ruby-tzinfo
    - ruby-rdoc
    - libpq
    - locomo-openrc
```

### Choosing a Stack

We're using alpine as the base image for all the containers that run the applications. We recommend using `alpine/3.17` for all applications. However please check the [alpine packages](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages) listing to see compatibility for your language and framework. In this case alpine/3.17 will run ruby `3.1.4`.

You can choose from the following:

- alpine/edge
- alpine/3.17
- alpine/3.16
- alpine/3.15

```yaml
stack: alpine/3.17
```

### Build

The below section tells PAKman how to actually build your application. In this case we're just setting the bundle config for deployment, running bundle install and compile assets. As you can see it's pretty straight forward.

```yaml
build:
  destinations: 
    - '*'
    - .bundle
  command: |
    bundle config set deployment 'true'
    bundle config set without 'development test'
    
    bundle install
    
    bundle exec rails assets:precompile
```

### Run

The below section explains how your application is run. You can see we have the ability to define `commands`. These are commands you wish to run like migrations or seeds if you have them.

The `services` section enables you to define how your application is run. How does it start? How does it stop? In this case we're using the kill pid. By default rails server creates pid file in the `tmp/pids` directory.

If you want to run workers you can define that as a separate service offered by your application. In this case the resulting worker will be started with `bundle exec sidekiq -C config/sidekiq.yml`

```yaml
run: 
  name: locomo
  commands: 
  - name: migrate
    binary: rails
    call: db:migrate
  services:
  - name: web
    binary: rails
    start: 
      call: server
    stop:
      kill: true
      pid_path: tmp/pids/server.pid
  - name: worker
    binary: bundle
    start:
      call: 'exec sidekiq -C config/sidekiq.yml'
```

### Hooks

These are the lifecycle of the alpine packages. You can define their behaviour. Generally we don't expect this to change from app to app. However feel free to adjust as required.

In this case `rc-update add locomo` will add our `locomo` app to the default run. This will ensure our app automatically starts when the container is restarted (incase it needs to restart).

The `rc-service locomo migrate` will run the migration. In this case it will run after the package is installed and after the upgrade.

- `rc-service locomo start` will start the application
- `rc-service locomo stop` will simply stop the application

Your application will be built into openrc and supervised by the [`s6` supervisor suite](https://github.com/skarnet/s6).

```yaml
hook:
  post-install: |
    rc-update add locomo
    rc-service locomo migrate
  pre-upgrade: |
    rc-service locomo stop
  post-upgrade: |
    rc-service locomo migrate
    rc-service locomo start
  post-deinstall: |
    rc-service locomo stop
    rc-update locomo rdio
```

## Putting it Together

The final file looks like the following:

```yaml
dependencies:
  build:
    - ruby
    - ruby-bundler
    - ruby-dev
    - ruby-tzinfo
    - libpq-dev
  runtime:
    - bash
    - curl
    - jq
    - ca-certificates
    - s6
    - ruby
    - ruby-bundler
    - ruby-tzinfo
    - ruby-rdoc
    - libpq
    - locomo-openrc

stack: alpine/3.17

build:
  destinations: 
    - '*'
    - .bundle
  command: |
    bundle config set deployment 'true'
    bundle config set without 'development test'
    
    bundle install
    
    bundle exec rails assets:precompile

run: 
  name: locomo
  commands: 
  - name: migrate
    binary: rails
    call: db:migrate
  services:
  - name: web
    binary: rails
    start: 
      call: server
    stop:
      kill: true
      pid_path: tmp/pids/server.pid
  - name: worker
    binary: bundle
    start:
      call: 'exec sidekiq -C config/sidekiq.yml'

hook:
  post-install: |
    rc-update add locomo
    rc-service locomo migrate

  pre-upgrade: |
    rc-service locomo stop

  post-upgrade: |
    rc-service locomo migrate
    rc-service locomo start

  post-deinstall: |
    rc-service locomo stop
    rc-update locomo rdio
```
