You will be able to setup your own Platform as a Service in a consistent manner without needing any complex tools. This documentation will guide you to quickly setup your own servers for simple single server deployments all the way to multi machine cluster that can scale to infinity and beyond.

## Storage

This documentation covers 3 providers. You'll need to setup the storage bucket in your service provider dashboard before continuing on instellar.app

+ Cloudflare R2
+ [Digital Ocean Spaces](/docs/storage/digital-ocean-spaces/)
+ [Amazon S3](/docs/storage/aws-s3/)

However you can choose to use your own object store of choice as long as it has S3 compatible API. Once you've setup your storage you'll need to input it into instellar.
