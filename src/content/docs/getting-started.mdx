You will be able to setup your own Platform as a Service in a consistent manner without needing any complex tools. This documentation will guide you to quickly setup your own servers for simple single server deployments all the way to multi machine cluster that can scale to infinity and beyond.

## Programming Languages

Below are the list of languages we currently support. We're currently working on expanding our support to other language and framework. If you don't see your specific language and framework listed below feel free to [reach out](mailto:support@instellar.app) and let us know

import Languages from '@components/docs/Languages.astro'

<Languages />

## Storage

This documentation currently covers the below listed providers, however if you're feeling like experimenting you can try any S3 compatible object storage. You'll need to setup the storage bucket in your service provider dashboard before continuing on instellar.app

import Storages from '@components/docs/Storages.astro'

<Storages />

However you can choose to use your own object store of choice as long as it has S3 compatible API. Once you've setup your storage you'll need to input it into instellar.
