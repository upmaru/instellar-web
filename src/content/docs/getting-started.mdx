  Instellar is a continuous deployment platform that will enable you to setup and deploy apps into your own platform as a service.
</span>

<YouTube id="oqlzh34AF4Q" />

You will be able to setup your own Platform as a Service in a consistent manner without needing any complex tools. This documentation will guide you to quickly setup your own servers for simple single server deployments all the way to multi machine cluster that can scale to infinity and beyond.

If you need a quick support and would like to chat you can join our [slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/upmaru/shared_invite/zt-1qncc89xi-Cwz1KiMHd19yI4IZmLcsGA).

## Storage

This documentation currently covers the below listed providers, however if you're feeling like experimenting you can try any S3 compatible object storage. You'll need to setup the storage bucket in your service provider dashboard before continuing on instellar.app

import Storages from '@components/docs/Storages.astro'

<Storages />

However you can choose to use your own object store of choice as long as it has S3 compatible API. Once you've setup your storage you'll need to input it into instellar.

## Setup a cluster

Setting up your own cluster is easy and straight forward. It can be done in < 10 minutes. We've created terraform modules to make this easy for you to setup. Checkout the videos below to see how we do this.


The video below will show you an example of how to use our [terraform module](/docs/setup-a-cluster/terraform/) to setup your own servers.

Once our servers are ready to go, the video below shows you how to setup [LXD cluster](/docs/setup-a-cluster/lxd/) to be integrated with instellar.app.
