You can configure S3 bucket in the following way.

### Creating a Bucket

Simply (I know it's not simple when you click the AWS menu and it covers your whole screen, but bear with me.) head over to the S3 screen

![s3 button](/docs/aws/s3-button.png)

Head over to the `Create bucket` button.

![create bucket](/docs/aws/create-bucket-button.png)

This will open up the `Create a bucket` form. Simply put in the bucket name you want to use and select the region closes to the servers you'll deploy your applications.

![create a bucket form](/docs/aws/create-a-bucket-form.png)

For access you can use the below configuration.

![bucket permissions](/docs/aws/bucket-permission-settings.png)

For encryption you can enable it if you want. Next we will need to create a policy to attach to a user with an api key which we will use in instellar.

### Creating a Policy

Head on over to the search bar and search for `iam` the following should show up.

![iam button](/docs/aws/iam-button.png)

Once you head over to the `iam` page look for the `policies` link on the left hand side.

![policies link](/docs/aws/policies-link.png)

Once you land on the `policies` page you'll see a `Create policy` button.

![create policy](/docs/aws/create-policy-button.png)

When creating the policy switch to the `json` tab and use the following policy.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
        "arn:aws:s3:::*/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:*:*:accesspoint/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:*:*:job/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Simply hit `Next` to the tags page. Add any tag you like or just skip and move to the next page. Finally enter the name of the policy something you'll easily search, maybe suffix / prefix the name with `instellar` so you know what it's for. Go a head and finish the creation process.

### Create a User

Once you have a policy you'll need to create a user and assign the policy to it.

![users menu item](/docs/aws/users-menu-item.png)

Find the button `Add user` and click it.

![add user](/docs/aws/add-user-button.png)

Simply choose a name you want and choose `access key` option for programatic access.

![create user form](/docs/aws/create-user-form.png)

Once you've set all the options click `Next`. On the next page you'll have the opportunity to select your policy.

![set user permissions](/docs/aws/set-user-permissions.png)

Search for the policy you created and select it and head to the `Next` page. Once you reach the last step you will see `Create user`. In the last step you will see a screen like this.

![user create success](/docs/aws/user-create-success.png)

You should copy the output of the `access key id` and `secret access key`

```shell
key: [generated]
secret: [generated]
```

This info combined with the bucket config should give you enough info to input into instellar.

```shell
bucket: your-bucket-name
host: [see below link]
region: [see below link]
```

You can retrieve the s3 `host` and `region` from [this page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html). As an example I use singapore region bucket. My host and region are

```shell
host: s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com
region: ap-southeast-1
```
